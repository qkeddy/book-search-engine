## Description
A full-stack Google Books API search engine built on MERNG stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server, GraphQL API and the Apollo Server. This code was derived from starter code that leveraged a RESTful API and has been refactored for efficiency.

A live demo of this application can be viewed [here](http://png-book-search.herokuapp.com/).
